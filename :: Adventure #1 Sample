/* Text: On my way home at the end of June. This past spring was the
 * longest I'd been away from home and my family. I spent my time at
 * Amherst post-semester working for a professor and learning what it
 * means to live on my own. I really do enjoy cooking for myself. [P] On
 * the plane ride back I was alternating between listening to music and
 * reading  [italicized] Dawnland Voices: An Anthology of Indigenous
 * Writing from New England edited by Siobhan Senier. I've only read the
 * Mi'kmaq section and a few pages of the Maliseet portion but already
 * I'm learning so much. @ everyone: read this book!! Especially if
 * you've spent anytime at all in the northeast(ern United States).
 * Worth it.

/* Text: My second full-day home I jumped in the water first thing in 
 * the morning and it felt so good. After weeks of swimming in the
 * strange, freshwater ponds that are so common in Western Mass., it was
 * nice to feel salt on my skin again.
