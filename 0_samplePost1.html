		<p>On the plane ride back I was alternating between listening to music and reading  [italicized] Dawnland Voices: An Anthology of Indigenous Writing from New England edited by Siobhan Senier. I've only read the Mi'kmaq section and a few pages of the Maliseet portion but already I'm learning so much. @ everyone: read this book!! Especially if you've spent anytime at all in the northeast(ern United States). Worth it. </p> </span>
