			<p>25 days I've been in New Zealand. I've felt... a million emotions. But, mostly: whole.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<p>After two years of living on the East Coast of the United States, in the middle of rural Massachusetts, I've finally returned to a place where I can see the ocean from my bedroom window, I'm surrounded by mountains, and the roads wind and curve like the coastlines they run against.</p>

			<p>I'm living in a massive city, but the country isn't more than a half hours' drive away. This place is absolutely beautiful.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<img class="multiRow" src="july_images/04_First Day.jpg" alt="First Day">

			<p>My first thirty-six hours here were a rollercoaster of emotions. Excitement, at finally arriving; dread, upon realising there was no Wi-Fi in my flat; and terror, in abruptly recognising the fact that I was in a foreign city with absolutely no local knowledge and no idea who to contact in case of emergency.</p>

		<div>
			<p>Luckily, I survived, found myself an Ethernet cord (and adaptor plug-in), and happily met up with my program the next morning at the airport. Orientation, and the rest of the semester, was set to begin.</p>

			<p>Now, school is in full swing and I'm enjoying my classes immensely. Te Ao Maori: The Maori World and Te Ao Hou / Contemporary Maori Issues, my two Maori Studies classes, force me every day to question what it means to be a Pacific Islander. With each reading, I beg the question: What does it meant to be indigenous?

			<br><br>Is it a blood quantum? A government-issued ID card? A tattoo? I don't know.

			<p>I sit in my Maori Studies courses here and wonder how I would feel taking Hawaiian Studies courses back home. Maybe I wouldn't suffer the 24/7 identity crises I do on the East Coast. Then again, maybe they'd be worse, being so close to the source.</p>

			<p>One thing's for sure, I wouldn't know as much about myself as I do now. I probably wouldn't care as much about being native Hawaiian, to be completely honest. You need to leave a place to appreciate the beauty it holds.</p>

			<p>Over the past three weeks I've traveled all over the greater Auckland, and a bit beyond! Every beach I visit, every hike I walk, the one thing I can't stop saying is: this place is so beautiful.</p>

			<p>All along the west coast lie spectacular black sand beaches, stretching for miles and miles, intermingled with caves, tide pools, and various other rock formations, enough to make a geologist wild. (s/o to Tekla #geo111).

			<br><br>I've found some 'opihi and Portuguese Man-Of-War (ew), but not many other familiar faces. Tidepools are always treasure troves of sea creatures.</p>

			<p>Being here is such a privilege and I'm forever grateful for this opportunity. To travel here and experience this amazing place is an adventure people spend lifetimes dreaming about. I am forever indebted to those who helped me get here. Mahalo piha.</p>
